# Recipe Dost Decision Log

## 2026-06-20
- Project created as Expo React Native + TypeScript app.
- Backend selected: Supabase Auth + Postgres + Edge Functions.
- App direction: Android-first, link-first AI recipe organizer.
- Compliance rule: save links, notes, metadata, and AI recipe cards only. Do not download videos.
- Free plan: 20 saved links, 3 AI recipe cards, 3 grocery lists.
- Paywall trigger: after first successful AI recipe card and after free usage limits.
- Development method: use ChatGPT for planning and Codex for repo changes.
- Initial Supabase schema migration added for auth.users-backed profiles, recipe links, AI recipe cards, collections, grocery lists, usage counters, subscriptions, metadata logs, and support tickets.
- RLS baseline: authenticated users can access only rows where user_id equals auth.uid(); service-role Edge Functions remain responsible for AI generation, usage enforcement, subscription sync, and metadata logging.
